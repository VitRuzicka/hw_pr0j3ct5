<img src="IMG/clock.png" ><br>
This project is simple driver for two displays of this type: 
<a href="https://www.tme.eu/cz/details/opd-s15013ly-bw/7-segment-led-displays/opto-plus-led/">TME link</a><br>
Houses two displays per module (daisy-chainable). One shift 74HC595 per register and has PWM.<br>
The main reason, why this exists is that there was a sale on the modules so I got them super cheap and the amber color looked really nice, so I've decided to build a <b>CLOCK</b>.<br>Features:<br><il>
