<h1>This is capacitive switch</h1>
<p>What can it do, I hear you ask. Well, just look:</p>

<p>The code is poorly written in ARDUINO ide, but who cares, right?</p>
<p>I would love to see someone make drop-in replacement for sonoff touch switch, but Im too lazy to do that, maybe later</p>
<p>For the function: it uses two ttp223 controllers to detect change in capacitance on two copper fills places on one side and therefore is able to detect basic gestures. I've only used it to detect if Im sliding the finger up to bottom(to turn off the output) or from bottom to up. It was also the test of ch32v003 and the <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun">corresponding repository</a> from cnlohr, which is awesome.</p>
